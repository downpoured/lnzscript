Getting started
==============
Currently, there is not an installer for Launchorz, and so the .zip file must be uncompressed to a folder of your choice.
There are currently two distributions: "command-line" and "form". 
The command-line is recommended, but if you have never used cmd.exe or a command-line interface, the "form" interface is provided.

If you choose the command-line interface:
Unzip the .zip file to a folder, possibly in Program Files.
Open cmd.exe (the command prompt) and cd into the directory.
Run lnzscript.exe.
You should see a LnzScript prompt. Type print('hello') and see if it works.
Open notepad or a code editor and create a file called 'test.js', containing print('hello')
Save this file into the directory.
From cmd.exe, inside the directory, run lnzscript.exe /f test.js
From now on, you can use both of these ways (interactive or script-based) to run LnzScript code.

If you choose the form interface:
Unzip the .zip file to a folder, possibly in Program Files.
Run lnzscriptform.exe and you should see a window with two text boxes.
Type "print('hello')" into the upper box and click Go. 
The lower box should respond with the text hello.
You can run scripts by typing text into the top box, and running it by pressing Go.


The basics
================
Here are some sample scripts to play with:

// dialogs
var res = Dialog.askYesNo('Question','Are you ready?');
if (res==Dialog.OK) print("That's good.");

// mouse
Mouse.move(1,1); 
// or, to get really crazy,
for (var i=0; i<15; i++) Mouse.move(Math.round(Math.random()*800), Math.round(Math.random()*800));
	
// keyboard
Process.open('notepad.exe')
Time.sleep(500); //wait for the program to open
Keyboard.send('hello!'); Time.sleep(100);
Keyboard.send('<Control>s'); //simulates the keystroke,opening Save dialog

// files
// note that you can use / in paths. If you use \, it must be escaped.
// these are equivalent:
var s = File.readFile('c:\\dir\\myfile.txt')
var s = File.readFile('c:/dir/myfile.txt')
var arFiles = File.dirListFiles('c:/dir', 'name'); //array of files in the folder sorted by name

//controls - this type of thing is useful
Process.open('calc.exe'); Time.sleep(500);
Keyboard.send('1');
Control.click('Calculator','Button60'); // click on the "+" button. Find control ids with a tool.
Keyboard.send('1');
Keyboard.send('{ENTER}');
Time.sleep(1500);
Control.setText('Calculator','403','1337'); //puts text into control id 403. 

// Misc. self-explanatory stuff
Screen.saveScreenshot('c:/shot.png', false)
Sound.mute()
Window.minimizeAll()
Process.systemShutdown()

Dialog
============
These functions are mainly straight-forward. 

Window
==============

Controls
================
Let's say you want a script to simulate clicking a button on a dialog. There are different ways one could approach this. One might measure the position of the button and use Mouse.move and Mouse.click to click at those coordinates, but this method is somewhat fragile - if the dialog is moved slightly, it could end up clicking somewhere unintended. A good choice is to find a keyboard shortcut for this, and simulate the keypress using Keyboard.send. If there is not a keyboard shortcut, though, or you want greater control you will have to use one of the Control methods.
