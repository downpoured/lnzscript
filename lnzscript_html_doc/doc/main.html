What is Lanuchorz?
============
The goal of the Launchorz project is to provide powerful Win32 automation tools - automating repetitive tasks.

LnzScript is the language used by Launchorz. It is a version of JavaScript with many additional libraries. LnzScript differs from the traditional use of JavaScript - it won't be run in a web browser,  and can interact with the filesystem. However, standard JavaScript code and idioms can still be used, including prototype-based classes.

Example of what Launchorz can do:
- in a file called test.js,

Process.open('notepad.exe')
Time.sleep(500);
Keyboard.send('hello!')
Dialog.askYesNo('Question','Did you expect this to happen?');

-now run lnzscript test.js, and watch what happens!


Why Launchorz?
===========
There are existing tools for Windows automation. One popular choice is AutoIt, and another strong project is AutoHotKey. LnzScript has a significant overlap of functionality with these tools, and exists for a very similar purpose.

The most important difference is that LnzScript is a true, comfortable language for those familiar with programming. AutoIt and AutoHotKey use a minimal BASIC-like language, which although may be easier for beginners, is not suitable for non-trivial functions. LnzScript has the feel of a more complete language rather than a list of instructions for a one-time use script. The C-style syntax is familiar to those who have worked languages such as  C++ or Java, and there is no need for labels and GOTO statements. Also, by being based on JavaScript (Ecma-262), there can be greater code re-use of algorithms. (For example, many JavaScript code examples exist online).

I would also claim that Launchorz is more extensible than AutoIt or AutoHotKey. It is not simple for a developer to add new functionality to these projects. In LnzScript, one can use the "include" function to import a code module. These modules can have private variables (declared with var) and prototype-based classes. This prevents name collissions and allows for information hiding.

Also, there are further plans for Launchorz beyond LnzScript. Expect to see a dedicated script editor, quick access to Launchorz from the keyboard, and more.

Current Implementation
=============
The details here may change, and are not necessarily important to users, but I am crediting what makes this project possible. LnzScript functions are currently provided by a combination of the Qt Toolkit by Trolltech, nircmd by nirsoft, the AutoItX dll, and the Windows api. The language is interpreted by Qt's QtScript module, an implementation of Ecma-262.
