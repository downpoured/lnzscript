Requirements:
Python 2.5
Qt 4.4
Mingw and GCC compiler

Note that there are preprocessing steps involved.
1)
Open the "Qt command prompt" , set directory to /trunk/lnzscript/
(The qt bin and gcc must be in the path, so I recommend the qt command prompt that comes with Qt)

2)
Run "qmake lnzconsole.pro" 

3) run build.bat, which should do the rest for you. This runs Python scripts that create c++ to be compiled.

4) If there were not errors, the "release" directory should contain a binary. 

To run this binary, I would recommend downloading an earlier release of LnzScript, and placing the binary into the same directory.
(This way, the binary will have all of its dependencies including qt dlls, wincommondialog.exe, nircmd.exe, mingw.dll and so on).
