Requirements:
Python 2.5
Qt 4.6.3, although 4.4 might work as well.
Mingw/GCC compiler

==Setup==
Set up a Qt build environment. Qt 4.6.3 requires Mingw 4.4, which I was able to find at the
TDM project site archives. 
http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download
Under sourceforge downloads,
tdm-mingw-1.905.0-4.4.0-2.exe, 26mb

edit build.bat to point to your Python directory.

==Building LnzScript==

1)
Open the "Qt command prompt" , set directory to /trunk/lnzscript/
(The qt bin and gcc must be in the path, so I recommend the qt command prompt that comes with Qt)

2)
Run "qmake lnzconsole.pro" 
Ignore the warnings about files not being found. These files are generated by a python script.

3) 
run build.bat, which should do the rest for you. This runs Python scripts that create c++ to be compiled.

4) If there were not errors, the "release" or "debug" directory should contain the binary. 

The easiest way to run this is to copy it into the directory of a 
previous release of LnzScript.
(This way, the binary will have all of its dependencies including qt dlls, wincommondialog.exe, nircmd.exe, mingw.dll and so on).


==documentation.xml===
lnzscript_html_doc/buildxmldoc.bat
creates documentation.xml

	documentation.xml and viewdoc.xsl -> lnzscript_html_doc/html, for documentation.
	lnzeditor\app\configuration\build_api_file\build.bat
		uses documentation.xml to produce lnzscript.api
	lnzdoc.xml used by docviewer.exe, if in same directory


==Building other projects==
Many other scripts depend on documentation.xml.
Building the editor can be done as described in its readme.
First build Scintilla, then build Scite.
I use MSVC 2005 to build the editor.
