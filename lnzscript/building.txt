Requirements:
Qt 4.4
Mingw and GCC compiler

Note that there are several preprocessing steps involved.
1)
Open command prompt, set directory to /trunk/lnzscript/
Using the "Qt command prompt" will include the right things in the path, recommended.

2)
Run "qmake testinterfaceconsole.pro" or "qmake testinterfaceform.pro" depending
on whether you are building the form, or the console interface.

From here on, build.bat should do the rest. Otherwise here are the steps:

3)
Run c:\python25\python .\provide_script\source\script_createcpp.py .\provide_script\source
(Change path to python if necessary).
This important step generates the .cpp files to be used later.

4) Run c:\python25\python .\provide_script\source\script_create_std_js.py .\provide_script\source .\release
Generates .js file

5)
Run "make"


6) If there were not errors, the "release" directory should contain a binary. Note that the binary must be able to find
qt Dlls (found in /trunk/distribution/lnzscript/common/QtDlls_extract_here.rar, or in one of the distributions)
as well as the autoit Dll.



(If you build the console, and then want to build the form interface, you might have to run "make clean".)
