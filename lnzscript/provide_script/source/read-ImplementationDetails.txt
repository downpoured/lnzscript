Scripts are run by QtScript, which provides an EcmaScript implementation.
Currently, the libraries are implemented by Qt, Au3, and Nircmd.
Qt is nice for more than QtScript - I use QStrings, and QFile/QDir/QProcess classes.

How to work with Windows
=========
(object way)
var win = Window.find('notepad')
win.move(23,32);

--this could be an ok interface.
--the problem: you can get the handle from au3, but the manipulating the window based on handle seems buggy. It works the first time, but doesn't afterwards.

So, we instead use an object.
Here are the possible ways to specify a window:

'Untitled'			Match starting with Untitled

'"Untitled - Notepad"'		Match exact string

'%Untitled%'			Match windows with part of string

''				Empty string - currently active window

{'title':'hello', 'class':'Notepad', 'instance':1} 	Pass an object. Specifies things.
