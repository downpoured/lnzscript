Todo
=============
Use qsrand() to seed rng
bug in editor: if provide arguments, should replace \ with \\, before passing.
isDirectory should also check fileexists
String.slice not defined

For development, it should be clear what the working directory should be for Python scripts

have an inno setup installer. registers js or jsz type?

execute Python? I suppose it could look in the registry for a Python installation.
Allow scripts to interface with Python - that'd be sweet. 
	new plan for Python - use Py2Exe to specifically expose some Python (html, zip)
	playsound - use windows api
	document argv?
	
database of contributed scripts
printerr to send to stderr?

For Release 0.3
==============
unit tests...
http download
"ask" input dialog, "choice" input dialog
CallDll, depending on how hard it is to implement
unify between NirCmd / Au3 window and dialog commands

for later
===========
ftp

Au3 Follow-up
============
Test relative coords, MouseCoordMode, PixelCoordMode
Test registry read and write, ones that return array
Registr.readKey - provide way to tell reason for failure - key ? value ? type of value?
File.driveMapAdd - provide way to tell reason for failure
AU3_ControlTreeView apparently isn't in the dll...

Missing: AU3_RunAsSet
	Would be good to implement, I guess, but FIRST find how to reset credentials.

Planned Features
================

Internet
------
	
	Internet.downloadURL
		Options:
		Python + py2exe
			(Around 1Mb)
			Current choice, because I already know it
			Also, I get zip file support nearly for free
		QtNetwork4.dll
			(1.215Mb)
			Less flexible, don't know it
		Libcurl or something?
		Of course, the least pretty solution is to distribute w/ au3 and call it
	
	
	Internet.getFavorites
		look at Launchy source? ff3?
	

Process
------
	LoadDll, CallDll would be *very* nice to have. Maybe from Autohotkey source?

Control
------
	nircmd dlgany, try to unify between nircmd and what au3 provides.
	
Mouse
------
	Investigate relative coords for au3. Note that nircmd has, setcursorwin (relative to window), movecursor (relative to current)

File
------
	directory - copy (with subdirs, files) move (with subdirs, files)\
	getDirectorySize
	getDriveType (cdrom, removable)
	-optional feature File.dirWalk - to make recursing through directories easier
	-optional feature File.dirListFilesPattern - list all entries matching *.txt and so on.

Dialog
--------
	Do NOT use qt for alert, msgbox, input, file dialogs, choice dialog, maybe even color dialog, etc.
	I changed my mind - Using qt for this introduces dependency on QtGui.dll which we don't really want.
	Use WinApi for simple dialogs, and SmartWin or Ultimate++ for the rest

Screen
-------
	-why not add this? AU3_PixelChecksum - because I wouldn't really use it.
	
	
Window
------
	consider adding nircmd win function

System
--------
	setEnvironmentvar

(Look through au3 / ahk docs and add good features)
(Look online for cool Au3 /autohotkey scripts and add features from them).

Weak plans
========
Wanted in Launchorz
--------------
DllCall



Wanted Kind of
--------------
printerr() - go to stderr
SetEnvironmentVar
directory - copy (with subdirs, files) move (with subdirs, files)
createDirectory, getDirectorySize

Somewhat wanted
--------------
getDriveType (cdrom, removable
DriveGetFileSystem (FAT, NTFS
MemGetStats  - Retrieves memory related information.
