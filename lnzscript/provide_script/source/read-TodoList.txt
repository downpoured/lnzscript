Todo
=============
Write general documentation for process, window, control.
Note to use [[br]] in documentation for line break.
Don't use sprintf for adding strings - it needlessly uses .toLatin1(). QStrToCStrPointer is a hack. Fix this by using string concat or .arg().
right now there are tons of literal strings like "copyDialog: argument 2 is not a bool". should be replaced with something like FMTSTRINGERROR(2, STR_BOOL) or FMTSTRINGERROR(impl_copydialog_string, 2, STR_BOOL)


Au3 Follow-up
============
Test relative coords, MouseCoordMode, PixelCoordMode
Test registry read and write, ones that return array
Registr.readKey - provide way to tell reason for failure - key ? value ? type of value?
File.driveMapAdd - provide way to tell reason for failure
AU3_ControlTreeView apparently isn't in the dll...

Missing: AU3_RunAsSet
	Would be good to implement, I guess, but FIRST find how to reset credentials.

Planned Features
================

Internet
------
	Ftp class or something.
	http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3-snapshot/qftp.html
	UrlDownload. There's a getUrl in AutoIt3, a hacky solution would be to call it ...
	OpenUrl - either a dll call, or "start" which uses shellExecute
	getFavorites - look at Launchy source?
	organizeIEFavorites - a dll call that opens the organizeFavorites box.

Process
------
	LoadDll, CallDll would be *very* nice to have. Maybe from Autohotkey source?

Control
------
	nircmd dlgany, try to unify between nircmd and what au3 provides.
	
Mouse
------
	Investigate relative coords for au3. Note that nircmd has, setcursorwin (relative to window), movecursor (relative to current)

File
------
	Get special folder paths !!!! !! !
	Get environment vars?
	-optional feature File.dirWalk - to make recursing through directories easier
	-optional feature File.dirListFilesPattern - list all entries matching *.txt and so on.

Dialog
--------
	use qt for alert, msgbox, input, file dialogs, choice dialog, maybe even color dialog, etc.

Screen
-------
	AU3_PixelChecksum
	AU3_PixelSearch
	
	
Window
------
	nircmd win

(Add from xls for opening control panels, using rundll32, and so on.)
(Look online for cool Au3 /autohotkey scripts and add features from them).
