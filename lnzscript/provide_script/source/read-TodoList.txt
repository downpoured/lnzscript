Todo
=============
Write general documentation for process, window, control.
Note to use [[br]] in documentation for line break.
For development, it should be clear what the working directory should be for Python scripts
Don't use sprintf for adding strings - it needlessly uses .toLatin1(). QStrToCStrPointer is a hack in this case. Fix this by using string concat or .arg().
right now there are tons of literal strings like "copyDialog: argument 2 is not a bool". should be replaced with something like FMTSTRINGERROR(2, STR_BOOL) or FMTSTRINGERROR(impl_copydialog_string, 2, STR_BOOL)
xsl file contains hack for removing "AU3_DEFAULT_VALUE"
document javascript std library, including Time.createTimer

when running a file get command line arguments?
have an inno setup installer that registers jsz type?
document the __name__ variable and test that it works

execute Python? I suppose it could look in the registry for a Python installation.
Allow scripts to interface with Python - that'd be sweet. 

database of contributed scripts

Au3 Follow-up
============
Test relative coords, MouseCoordMode, PixelCoordMode
Test registry read and write, ones that return array
Registr.readKey - provide way to tell reason for failure - key ? value ? type of value?
File.driveMapAdd - provide way to tell reason for failure
AU3_ControlTreeView apparently isn't in the dll...

Missing: AU3_RunAsSet
	Would be good to implement, I guess, but FIRST find how to reset credentials.

Planned Features
================

Internet
------
	
	
	Ftp class or something. libcurl?
	http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3-snapshot/qftp.html
	UrlDownload. There's a getUrl in AutoIt3, a hacky solution would be to call it ...
	getFavorites - look at Launchy source?
	

Process
------
	LoadDll, CallDll would be *very* nice to have. Maybe from Autohotkey source?

Control
------
	nircmd dlgany, try to unify between nircmd and what au3 provides.
	
Mouse
------
	Investigate relative coords for au3. Note that nircmd has, setcursorwin (relative to window), movecursor (relative to current)

File
------
	Get environment vars? QEnvironment?
	-optional feature File.dirWalk - to make recursing through directories easier
	-optional feature File.dirListFilesPattern - list all entries matching *.txt and so on.

Dialog
--------
	Do NOT use qt for alert, msgbox, input, file dialogs, choice dialog, maybe even color dialog, etc.
	I changed my mind - Using qt for this introduces dependency on QtGui.dll which we don't really want.

Screen
-------
	-why not add these? it'd be easy
	AU3_PixelChecksum
	
	
Window
------
	consider adding nircmd win 

(Look online for cool Au3 /autohotkey scripts and add features from them).
