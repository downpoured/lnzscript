For version 0.4
	
	Examples
		Include more examples
		Set up wiki for examples. Done - see project page. http://code.google.com/p/launchorz/wiki/
	
	Editor
		Point to correct website, not sites.google.com
		Should not pass "" "" "" "" arguments to scripts
		bug in editor: if provide arguments, should replace \ with \\, before passing.

		
	Scripts
		System.openControlPanel and System.openUtility should be cleaned up, probably using an enum
			(User would type System.openControlPanel(System.Panel_Keyboard))

		File.createShortcut, allow a target with arguments. http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2005-01/msg00241.html
		wincommondialog input dialog, Dialog.input, field should get focus  --DONE.
		
		file.getShortcutTarget, and others from QT  should return paths like
		c:\foo
		not
		c:/foo
		isDirectory should also check fileexists
		
		unify between NirCmd / Au3 window and dialog commands
		
		File.copyDirectory, File.moveDirectory (with subdirs)
		File.dirListFilesPattern - list all entries matching *.txt and so on.
		-File.dirWalk - to make recursing through directories easier
		
		equivalents of os.path, os.path.join, os.path.split. UNC paths? weird paths? 

	Other
		Make an installer that associates .jsz. maybe even drag/drop onto, py does that
		Make editor.exe more visible when you download it?
		Use qsrand() to seed rng
		dev environment-make working directories clear, clear up build process, and build doc process
		
		
		
Guidelines
	Focus on things that python isn't good at. Maybe we can have better file/handling, quick scripts to rename files, etc.
		(could look at Python's shellutil for copy file, copy directory, move directory, etc. recurse through dir, too, maybe.)
	Look at ahk for possible.
	Look at good Au3 /ahk scripts online


Probably for later release
	Internet.downloadURL. Wget-like URL retrieval would be nice. Options: 
		Python + py2exe
			(Around 1Mb)
			Current choice, because I already know it
			Also, I get zip file support nearly for free
		QtNetwork4.dll
			(1.215Mb)
			Less flexible, don't know it
		Libcurl
		Non-option - distribute w/ au3 and call it
	setEnvironmentvar
	better build env, maybe templates in subfolder instead of sources, write internal docs so that it could make sense


Maybe for a later release
	CallDll, depending on how hard it is to implement (see ahk src?)
	getDirectorySize
	update scite version... not worth it now
	Python can call LnzScript (extension/subprocess), LnzScript can call Python?
	
	
	
	
	We could add the following features by having a python tool. (best if a py2exe'd exe)
		ftp
		wget-like file retrieval. http sending via post/get. could automate some things that way.
		zip file (but qt also supports zip)
	
	a printerr to send to stderr
	a directory Dialog, not really worth it
	
	Interact with IE/firefox bookmarks
	
	Registr.readKey - provide way to tell reason for failure - key ? value ? type of value?
	File.driveMapAdd - provide way to tell reason for failure
	AU3_ControlTreeView, for interacting w treeviews, apparently isn't provided by the dll...
	AU3_RunAsSet, AU3_PixelChecksum, might not be used
	getDriveType (cdrom, removable
	DriveGetFileSystem (FAT, NTFS
	MemGetStats  - Retrieves memory related information.

	

More unit tests...
	Test relative coords, MouseCoordMode, PixelCoordMode
	Test registry read and write, ones that return array
	
Note that we probably don't want to introduce a dependency on the large QtGui.dll
	Can use winapi (wincommondialog.exe) for msgbox, input, file dialogs. 
	SmartWin and Ultimate++, at least with default themes, look ugly.
