having Python would give me:

	FTP

	webbrowser - no, doesn't really offer anything beyong Process.openFile

	Html, and html / post
	zip files !! !! !!

		I could also get this from Qt, which would actually be _smaller_ 
		But for zip files, I know 
		

	regular expressions?

	shutil-prob. not

Use Javascript to write
	splitpath
	path.split
	path.join
	



Or, use freeze to pack it into an exe - somehow I think this is a better choice... 


include('<ftp>')

todo: implementation:c++_winext for things that should be such - this is pretty much done, not all but some
