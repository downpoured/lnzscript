Unit tests are kept in this directory. 

To run tests, first run create_methods_list.py (from this directory).
This will create the file methods_list.txt.

Then, run the script main.js, which will perform all tests specified. (Enable a test by uncommenting it in main.js). This will show a summary of how many tests were run.

Tests should be organized by namespace. As can be seen, the eventual goal is to have at least one test for every function in the API. That is the purpose of the "registerTest" function.
