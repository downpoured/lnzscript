LnzEditor Internal Documentation
==============================

The LnzEditor is a custom build of the SciTE code editor.

To build editor:
	Requires: C++ compiler, Windows
	General instructions are in , or do the following:
	Known to work with Vs .NET 2003, other versions may require minor changes
	Open the "Vs command prompt" (this puts compiler in the path, and defines environment variables)
	Navigate to /trunk/lnzeditor/app/scintilla/win32/
	Run nmake -f scintilla.mak
	Navigate to /trunk/lnzeditor/app/scite/win32/
	Run nmake -f scite.mak
	The output will go in the bin folder.

To run editor:
	The file Scite.exe and SciLexer.dll are what are needed.
	These files should be copied to the folder /trunk/lnzeditor/app/configuration/wscite/
	SciTE.exe should be renamed to lnzeditor.exe

To set up tooltips:
	Run /trunk/lnzscript_html_doc/buildxmldoc.bat to generate documentation.xml
	Copy documentation.xml to /trunk/lnzeditor/app/configuration/build_api_file/
	Run /trunk/lnzeditor/app/configuration/build_api_file/build.bat
		(This should create the file /trunk/lnzeditor/app/configuration/build_api_file/lnzscript.api)
	Move this .api file into /trunk/lnzeditor/app/configuration/wscite/properties/
	Now the tooltips will be up to date


scite_msg:
	A tool for other programs to communicate with Scite. 
	Developed with Vs .NET 2003, should build with other compilers with appropriate settings
	Open the solution and build it.
