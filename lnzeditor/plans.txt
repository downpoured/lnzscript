LnzEditor Plans
=================

	Create "clipboard", 5th screen-cast


	



For 0.3 release
-------------------

Bugs
	System.openUtility broken
	minor bug in File.ini* for return values, returns true even if false
	eliminate pause on closing program - only one temp file
	
Test cases
	cover the api with tests
	
Bugs
	File.dirListFiles() doesn't include hidden files
	in for line expand-deletes preceding comments?
	
	File.createShortcut only works for simple shortcuts. Will have to use winapi
	http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:5RhesI33NygJ:www.codeproject.com/KB/winsdk/makelink.aspx+windows+api+create+shortcut&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us

C++
	Add @'c:\test' feature
	
	include(), prevent something from including itself.
	
	actually add Internet.openUrl method. Right now it's just a hack, in std.js. And even worse, it's in timer.js.
	
Features

	Instead of putting many temp files in a tmp directory, just have one temp file. Then no pause on app close.

	format output of on error, so that if you click output pane it will take you to error
	
	context help-lua or something looks at the words you are at, and opens the doc browser to that word


	Python features: zip, url (and eventually ftp)

	prototype for arrays, .shuffle()

	add a way to detect the Python directory
		this could be done with an lnzscript .js file
		findpython.js searches for c:\python30\python.exe, c:\python21\Python.exe, until match
		then writes a text file like _pythondir.properties
		note that "import nonexistantfile" doesn't show an error
		
	passing arguments to a run command
		should be able to just write command.go.*.py=pythonw -u "$(FileNameExt)" $(args)
		which should add quoting of arguments, and just as many arguments as needed

	Add smartwin features
		http://smartwinlib.org/doc/class_in_dialog.html
		Dialog.input
		Dialog.choice http://smartwinlib.org/doc/class_choice_string.html
		
	For System.openControlPanel and related,
		make options non-case sensitive.
	

Installer
	Optionally (but on by default) associates .js files with the editor.
	I considered the extension .jsz, but using .js means that files will be highlighted in other editors

Run tests on Vista

For 0.4? release
---------------------
Bugs

	in the Options menu, only 2 languages are included regardless of settings. not elegant
	
Documentation - consistent usage of "folder" or "directory"
consistent usage of return values - false or null or -1?

Cleanup
	make g_nircmd_directory string a static member, not a global variable
	add "licenses" directory in output




Long term
-------------
Run command. A file can, in the first line, provide a run command, such as "//# Runcommand:`run main.py`" which will be seen by Scite.

End goal: a launchy that doesn't have to index at all

Document IDM changes/additions, provide them to Lua with the .iface file

Cleanup
	Ctrl+; and Ctrl+. are set by user.shortcuts, instead of in the C++ code. Maybe slightly less good.
