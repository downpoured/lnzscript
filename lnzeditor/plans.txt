LnzEditor Plans
=================


For 0.3 release
-------------------
Bugs
	fix System.openUtility
	minor bug in File.ini* for return values, returns true even if false
	include(), prevent something from including itself. Have a QStringlist of what has been included.
	File.dirListFiles() doesn't include hidden files. Document or fix this.
	in for line expand-deletes preceding comments?
	For System.openControlPanel and related, make options non-case sensitive. Should be easy


Features
	add @'c:\test' feature to main. Document this feature.
	Dialog.input() to get a string
		Was considering Smartwin++, but this may not work out (if it looks ugly)
		CodeProject examples look ugly.
		If all else fails, use a .NET 1.1 program in C# which would be trivial (but introduces .NET dependency).
	add DocViewer to editor.
	Python features: zip, url


Test cases
	cover the api with tests
	Run tests on Vista
	



	
For 0.4 release
----------------

Features
	Investigate DllCall method
	
	Create a new File.createShortcut that can handle 
		File.createShortcut only works for simple shortcuts. Will have to use winapi
		http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:5RhesI33NygJ:www.codeproject.com/KB/winsdk/makelink.aspx+windows+api+create+shortcut&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us
	
	format output of on error, so that if you click output pane it will take you to error

	add a way to detect the Python directory
		this could be done with an lnzscript .js file
		findpython.js searches for c:\python30\python.exe, c:\python21\Python.exe, until match
		then writes a text file like _pythondir.properties
		note that "import nonexistantfile" doesn't show an error
	
	passing arguments to a run command
		should be able to just write command.go.*.py=pythonw -u "$(FileNameExt)" $(args)
		which should add quoting of arguments, and just as many arguments as needed

	Add more dialogs
		Dialog.choice, perhaps choosing from a handful of items.
		Would be good for smartwin++ if it didn't look so ugly.
		Consider Dialog.openFolder, which Smartwin++ can add easily
		Dialog.choice http://smartwinlib.org/doc/class_choice_string.html\
		http://smartwinlib.org/doc/class_in_dialog.html
		
	

	Installer
		Optionally (on by default?) associates .js files with the editor.

Create "clipboard", 5th screen-cast ?


For 0.5? release
---------------------
Bugs

	in the Options menu, only 2 languages are included regardless of settings. not elegant
	
Documentation - consistent usage of "folder" or "directory"
consistent usage of return values - false or null or -1?

Cleanup
	make g_nircmd_directory string a static member, not a global variable
	add "licenses" directory in output
	
	note Internet.openUrl is in provide_script.cpp, not very elegant.


Long term
-------------

Features
	ftp, via Python

The Launchor
	a fork of launchy that doesn't have to index at all

Editor
	context help-lua or something looks at the words you are at, and opens the doc browser to that word
	(this isn't easy with the current doc-viewer, although Scite already has the capability)
	
	Ctrl+; and Ctrl+. are set by user.shortcuts, instead of in the C++ code. Maybe slightly less good.
	
	Document IDM changes/additions, provide them to Lua with the .iface file


Scite Modifications
	scite with Python instead of Lua
	
	Scite recognizes a special comment specifying "Run command". A file can, in the first line, provide a command, such as "//# Runcommand:`run main.py`" 
	
	announce to scite-interest list
