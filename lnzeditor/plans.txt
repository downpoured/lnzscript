LnzEditor Plans
=================

High Priority
------------------
Bugs
	abbrev.properties in wrong place. probably constant. "..\abbrev" -> "abbrev"
	Options directory still incorrect?

Important changes
	designate properties files starting with _ not to appear in menu
	

Do on Monday
------------------
After compiling, check that these changes are correct:
	About dialog says "lnz scite in wrong place"
	Document user.shortcuts additions
	change things so that Ctrl+L deletes line, Ctrl+Shift+X and Ctrl+Shift+L cuts line
	add Ctrl+E , Ctrl+Shift+E for show name in explorer and so on


Before 0.2 release
---------------
Documentation
	
	Configuration
		command.scite.helponline
		see _lnzscite.properties for what to define
	
	About this editor
	Write use cases
		-quick one-off scripts
		project dependencies in visual studio
		open websites in different tabs
	
	Document '<std.js>' features
	Document for(23 feature
	
C++
	Add @'c:\test' feature



After 0.2 release
---------------
Bugs
	command.lnzcleanup is called on buffer close, not app close
	in the "Options" menu, only 2 languages are included regardless of settings. not elegant
	

Features
	add a way to detect the Python directory
		this could be done with an lnzscript .js file
		findpython.js searches for c:\python30\python.exe, c:\python21\Python.exe, until match
		then writes a text file like _pythondir.properties
		note that "import nonexistantfile" doesn't show an error
		
	passing arguments to a run command
		should be able to just write command.go.*.py=pythonw -u "$(FileNameExt)" $(args)
		which should add quoting of arguments, and just as many arguments as needed


Long term
-------------
Document IDM changes/additions, provide them to Lua with the .iface file

Ctrl+; and Ctrl+. are set by user.shortcuts, instead of in the C++ code. Maybe slightly less good.
