The Python 2.6 documentation is stored in .rst, reStructuredText format.

I went through the library documentation quickly and copied some of the .rst into new files, filtering out some that were 2.6-specific, os-specific, obsolete, or uninteresting to me. I added ===Section:this=== divisions.

The most valuable part of this is the re-organization of the library into sections. In my opinion this is a better organization than given in the official docs.

Because the current amount of information seems to be "good enough" (and people who want more Python information can just look at the actual docs) I'm not planning on furthering this or adding more. 

So, don't expect this to be great, documented, or complete.
