I am currently not using or promoting the lnz "launcher."
There is always Launchy, the inspiration, but that has the following issues:
	matches occur anyplace in the string "fox" matches "firefox"
	Can take up cpu
	limited to alt-space, keystroke, enter. so
	4 keystrokes at the *Minimum*. not fast.


I am currently recommending:
Clavier+ 10.6.1
http://utilfr42.free.fr/util/Clavier.php
It's modern and win7/vista compatible, and open source.




Other options that did not look as appealing:
